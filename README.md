# Healthcare Cost Analysis and Optimization Using Tableau

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare costs to identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize expenditure patterns. Using a synthetic dataset, the project explores cost trends across departments, procedures, insurance types, and locations. The analysis is visualized using Tableau to provide actionable insights for healthcare cost management.

## Objectives
1. **Analyze Healthcare Costs**: Identify high-cost departments, procedures, and regions.
2. **Visualize Data**: Create interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize cost trends and relationships.
3. **Optimize Expenditure**: Provide actionable recommendations to reduce costs without compromising patient care.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python**: For generating synthetic data.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is synthetically generated and includes the following columns:
- **Patient_ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Department**: Department where the treatment was performed (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics).
- **Procedure**: Type of procedure (e.g., MRI, Surgery).
- **Medication_Cost**: Cost of medications.
- **Procedure_Cost**: Cost of the procedure.
- **Hospital_Stay_Duration**: Duration of hospital stay in days.
- **Total_Cost**: Total cost (Medication + Procedure + Hospital Stay).
- **Insurance_Type**: Type of insurance (Private, Public, Uninsured).
- **Outcome**: Outcome of the treatment (Recovered, Readmitted, Ongoing).
- **Location**: Location of the hospital (e.g., New York, California).
- **Patient_Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Severity_Level**: Severity of the condition (Low, Medium, High).

## Steps to Reproduce the Project
1. **Generate Synthetic Data**:
   - Run the Python script (`Satyam_healthcare_generateSyntheticData.ipynb`) to generate the synthetic dataset.
   - The dataset will be saved as `custom_healthcare_cost_data.csv`.

2. **Analyze Data in Tableau**:
   - Load the dataset (`custom_healthcare_cost_data.csv`) into Tableau.
   - Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, line charts, maps).
   - Build a dashboard to visualize cost trends and relationships.

3. **Identify Insights**:
   - Analyze high-cost departments, procedures, and regions.
   - Provide actionable recommendations for cost optimization.

## Files in the Repository
- `Satyam_healthcare_generateSyntheticData.ipynb`: Python script to generate synthetic healthcare cost data.
- `custom_healthcare_cost_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset generated by the Python script.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `Satyam Healthcare Cost Analysis.twb`: Tableau File with generated visualisations.
  
## Insights and Recommendations
High-Cost Departments: Cardiology and Oncology have the highest total costs.

Cost vs. Outcome: Higher costs do not always lead to better outcomes (e.g., some high-cost patients were readmitted).

Insurance Type: Private insurance patients incur higher costs compared to public or uninsured patients.

Regional Analysis: New York and California have the highest total costs, possibly due to higher living costs.

Future Work
Incorporate real-world healthcare data for more accurate analysis.

Build predictive models to forecast future costs and patient outcomes.

Integrate the dashboard with live data feeds for real-time cost monitoring.
